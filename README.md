// this is an unfinished Tic Tac Toe which im unable to stop the history counter after a win if a user continues to click.

// Please do mention a workaround on this as im still a fresher in Javascript programming or should i say Dom

// Also im looking for people that I can collaborate with, I know one can be powerful when working solely but we can also be more powerful when working together

// Thanks  in advance mate
